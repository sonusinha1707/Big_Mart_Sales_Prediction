## 📊 Problem Statement

Retail companies like Big Mart want to understand which features influence the sales of products and how to forecast them. This project analyzes sales data of various products across multiple outlets of Big Mart.

---

## 🔍 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
2. **Handling Missing Values**
3. **Feature Engineering**
4. **Data Visualization**
5. **Model Building**
6. **Performance Evaluation**
7. **Final Predictions**

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (EDA)
- Scikit-learn (ML models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📈 Model Performance

- Evaluated using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and **R² Score**
- Cross-validation used to avoid overfitting
- Best performing model saved (e.g., Random Forest Regressor)

---

## 📂 Data Summary

Dataset includes fields like:

- `Item_Identifier`, `Item_Weight`, `Item_Fat_Content`, `Item_Visibility`
- `Outlet_Identifier`, `Outlet_Establishment_Year`, `Outlet_Size`, `Outlet_Location_Type`
- Target Variable: `Item_Outlet_Sales`

---

## 🔮 Goal

Predict `Item_Outlet_Sales` using given features and generate submission for competition or business insight.

---

## 🛠️ To Run Locally

1. Clone the repo or open the notebook
2. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

3. Open the notebook using Jupyter or VSCode and run the cells

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Deploy model with Streamlit/Flask UI
- Try advanced models (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Feature selection via Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
